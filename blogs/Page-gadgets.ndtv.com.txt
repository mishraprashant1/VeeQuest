Best budget phone.
By Amit Kumar | 8 Oct 2018
Pros- 1.) FHD+ Display with less bezels. 2.) Battery life is very good. 3.) Front Camera is awesome with potrait mode. 4.) Face Recognition and Fingerprint Scanner. Cons:- 1.) Hybrid Sim-Slot (SIM1 + SIM2/SD Card) 2.) Rear Camera is average. I'm using this device since July and fully satisfied with Redmi Note 5. The only problem I faced is Rear Camera suffers in low-light conditions. Rest is fine. So I recommend people to buy Xiaomi Redmi Note 5.
