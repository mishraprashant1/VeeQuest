                                      1.0 out of 5 starsExceeded my expectations... at first- UPDATE
                                      August 18, 2018
                                      Format: ElectronicsVerified Purchase
                                      I was not expecting a lot for a $177, but I couldn't have been more wrong about this phone. It is on par with my note 8. camera quality isn't the best, but it's not horrible by any means. I highly recommend it.
                                      
                                      Update 11/15/2018
                                      I am still seriously impressed with this phone. I want to go into more detail. The original picture I posted was a cropped photo, so the quality isn't as sharp as my other photos.
                                      Pics 2 and 3 show close up rear camera photos, 4 shows a rear camera far distance shot, and 5 is a selfie camera shot.
                                      The battery life is also freaking phenomenal on this phone. It last me 12 hours at work, (on nights I can play on it all night) and still have half a battery when I leave.
                                      The screen quality is fantastic. The only downside is that it does leave smudges, BUT I have dropped this sucker face down 3 million times and it's still strong as ever.
                                      No bloatware issues, the phone does come with Mi preinstalled apps, but they're useful, like the calendar, calculator, there's a radio app, and it even comes preinstalled with a remote app (which is great for people like me who have no idea where their TV remote is, double bonus, my husband's note 8 doesn't have an IR blaster).
                                      All in all, I'm glad I took the chance with this phone. I was concerned about the the OS being an Android variant, but it actually runs very very fast and smooth. No complaints whatsoever. I will update again in the future.
                                      
                                      Update 12/17
                                      A month later I am not too happy. 4 months exactly I've had this phone, and while it's operations are still the same, it's developing a very serious screen burn radiating from the volume control contacts inside the phone for some reason. I have a small semi circle radiating from the volume down button about a quarter inch out from the edge of the screen to the edge, and it's about half an inch long. A second half circle is beginning to form on the volume up contact point in the same manner. So now I have 2 half circle burns on the edge of my screen. This phone is 4 months old. It's never overcharged or overheated, and I don't know why these contact points are over heating (and they felt physically hot when the first one started forming, I could feel it on my phone screen). I don't know how to contact Mi, so I'll adjust my rating if they contact me to sort this out. Otherwise, I'm not so sure I'd recommend this product now if the components are going to start over heating after 90-120 days of owning.

                                      5.0 out of 5 starsI was extremely worried until now

                                      So I had a ZTE blade x max on cricket and since I can't get updates thanks to tariffs against the company in the US I needed a phone. Couldn't make my self pay top dollar that cricket was asking for the only other 6 inch screen phone. I found the terms 5 note. I pondered and thought about it a week then ordered it. While only having to wait for two days for it to get here I read millions of reviews of people complaining and saying doesn't work or got European charger and so on. All where from other companies. Well I got my phone today came right on time and it came with the US charger not an adapter but normal 120 to 240 USA electrical engineering spec charger. So felt little better. Then I logged on cricket wireless check my phone from there website. Entered my imei found on the phone and guess what excellent service. Took out my sim card from my ZTE and put it in my redmi perfection. I'm actually writing this review with it now. Phone is awesome smooth os and as soon as I turned on Wi-Fi I'm now with Android Oreo 8.0 . Been waiting for that for ever. This phone is awesome. Now the company whom I bought it from exceeded my expectations by far. I contacted them to ask some questions before I got the phone
                                      They responded within the same hour that I sent the message both times. Super happy with their customer service. I've got 4 kids and my wife which I'm going to buy phones for and I will not go through anyone else ever again. Y'all got good service. Oh I also am fortunate enough to live close to Houston which will have all 5g by 2020. Redmi note 5 will be able to get service with that too already can confirm due to some AT&T towers are already 5g in downtown. Don't let this phone slip out of your reach go ahead and get it this company is on point.

                                      Update: phone got super hot.. I thought it was going to catch on fire. It wasn’t even charging, and had a full battery. It was sitting on table and I picked it up. I thought I burned my hand. The battery literally drained without the screen even being on. I’m not even sure if I can return it, I just bought it less than a month ago.
                                      
                                      I just got the phone today. In all honesty, it’s a great phone. So far I’m loving it. It’s more smoother and seems much more better than my iPhone 6 Plus. First time I had an android in my life, been with iPhone for about 8 years. The prices are too high so I needed a 200$ or less alernative. I didn’t expect this quality, so far I don’t have complaints but I would have to use it more. One thing I noticed was I saw a lot of Indian reviews saying it has face unlock... well it does, but it only works if you set region to India. Then go into phone lock settings and u can add the face scan. It’s so lame we have to set it to India for that. I’m surprised it has Infra-red light so it can be used as a tv remote on any device. That’s a huge bonus for me. I would recommend this phone to my family or anyone who doesn’t want to spend big cash on a flagship phone. Can play high graphic games and the microphone works great. It also shipped very fast. I’ll update if anything major happens in the next month or so. If not, it’s cus the phone is good. I did a lot of research before I bought it so I knew what to expect lol. Also, not sure why the instructions were only in Spanish but it’s not a big deal I never read them anyways. Came with a clear black silicone case on the back. It was tucked in the booklet box. Comes with American charger box and cable. No headphones but that’s fine. I’m guessing this is the best phone for the value so don’t hesitate.
