From capturing enchanting pictures with the rear camera and an amazing front camera, to watching videos and playing games on the FHD+ display, this smartphone ensures you never have a dull moment again.
18:9 Full-screen Display

The 15.2-cm (5.99) FHD+ display takes your visual experience to the next level. Enjoy watching videos and playing games on this display which uses an 18:9 aspect ratio. Compared to the conventional 16:9 ratio format, this phone’s increased aspect ratio provides a wider field-of-view, giving you a competitive edge while gaming.

Durable

Apart from providing an incredible look and feel, the 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass display is resistant to wear, making it highly durable.

Big on Battery

Keep the fun going on for a long period, thanks to the high-capacity 4000 mAh battery. It offers up to 165 hours of music playback, 15 hours of video playback, 9 hours of gaming time, or up to 17 days of standby time.

Powerful Performance

Powered by a 2 GHz octa-core Snapdragon 625 processor and Adreno 506 GPU, this phone runs your apps and games seamlessly.

Say Cheese

The large pixel-size (1.25 micrometre) of the rear camera (12 MP) lets you take stunning images even in low-lighting conditions.

Selfie Camera

Take display-picture-worthy selfies effortlessly with the 5 MP front camera even in low light, thanks to the LED Selfie-light provided. Also, you are provided with smart facial feature enhancements using Beautify 3.0.

Fluid Experience

Enjoy a fast and fluid smartphone experience, thanks to 3 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and the MIUI 9 user interface.

Hybrid Slot

You can choose to use two SIM cards simultaneously or use one SIM card and a micro SD card as per your preference.

Storage Capacity

You can store all your photos, music, and videos, thanks to 32 GB of internal memory which can be expandable up to 128 GB.

MIUI 9 - Lightning Fast

It recognizes your train ticket SMS messages and turns them into simple cards that have all the important information. Mi Video supports popular video formats and subtitles, and smartly groups episodes by the show name. It also allows you to hide videos. With Mi Drop, you can seamlessly transfer files between devices (Android 4.4 or later) without an Internet connection. The App vault lets you access your most used features and info without searching for them.

Value-for-money

First of all 5* for fk, fast delivery within 24 hrs.
Great, keep it up. Now come to mobile, let's see.
(1) Display is clear & bright with fhd but tall one due to 18 :9 ratio. If you are using for first time it will take some time to adjust it, then afterwards no problem. So 9/10
(2) Battery is great, 4000 mah is easily last for 2 days with moderate to heavy usage. So 10/10
(3) Sound is average from speakers, not at all loud. Disappointing, actually it should have dual speakers as cost is 10k....
