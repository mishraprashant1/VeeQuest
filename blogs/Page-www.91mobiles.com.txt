Bad quality
24 Feb 2018 By Vipul Kumar Sahu On flipkart.com
Camera quality is not up to the mark. Screen size is good but having an issue with it that when we play any video song the video is not shown on its full screen(5.99) like other devices, video is shown only 5.5 or something....

Just okay
04 Sep 2018 By Subham Suda On flipkart.com
A honest Review Pros - Great look and Feel. (I bought the Blue Colour) Handy, Durable and good build quality. Battery Backup is excellent. Display is also fine with the Full HD+ Resolution. Touch response and feel is good and fingerprint is very responsive. No lag in Gaming and processes fast, No heating issue or such. UI is Impressive. Cons Rear Camera is the worst in the segment, compared to other 10K+ Smartphones. Blurry edges and unfocused pictures. Front is good if you are not a Selfie Addict. Full Display does not make Sense as if you open a video it will become too short from the edges. Not a Practical Full Display phone. Speakers - Single Speakers with a false Twin speakers Design don`t know why. The single speaker is loud but sound quality remains average no dolby or such audio enhancement support. Little Bulky feel because of the 4000 Mah battery or maybe Metal design. No fast CHARGE Support or so, takes around 4 hrs to full charge. Overall if you need a Protection and safety, (easy service and spare parts availabilty) of using a phone for a long time then go with this Redmi Note 5. and in terms of some Smart features and use it lack behind others. Specially CAMERA Assembled in India, Not made.

    You don't need to enable VoLTE. Insert the Jio (VoLTE enabled) in any slot. By default, VoLTE will be active. If it is not, you can change the network preferences from Network option in settings.


    

     1. Go to Settings > Call Settings (Sim and Network)

     2. Tap Cellular networks > Enable Voice over LTE On/ Off.

    Alternatively, you can follow a much easier way:


    

     1. You can simply dial *#*#4636#*#*

     2. Choose Phone information.
     3. Click " Phone Information" and Toggle VOLTE Provisioned.
     4. Restart the phone and you are done.
