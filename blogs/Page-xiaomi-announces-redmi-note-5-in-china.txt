Featuring flagship-level photography capabilities for great photos


BEIJING, China, 16 March 2018 — Global technology leader Xiaomi officially announced Redmi Note 5 in China today, which features flagship-level photography capabilities. With a dual camera featuring a large 1.4μm-pixel sensor, AI camera features, and an LED Selfie light for its front camera, Redmi Note 5 is a powerful device that takes amazing photos anywhere, at any time.


Redmi Note 5 also marks the debut of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 platform in China. It will be available in China on 20 March starting from RMB 1099.


Clearer images and faster focusing even in low light


Redmi Note 5 sports a dual camera setup, a combination usually adopted only in flagship smartphones. The main 12-megapixel sensor features large 1.4μm pixels, which can capture more light and deliver better results under low-light conditions.


The camera is also armed with 2PD (dual photodiode) autofocus — a technology commonly seen in professional dSLR cameras, which results in a much faster autofocus speed. Every single pixel of the main 12-megapixel sensor contains two photodiodes (which convert light into current that can be measured) – resulting in 24 million photodiodes in total, which is nearly 30 times more than the number of photodiodes of traditional PDAF-enabled sensors of the same resolution. This allows the sensor to measure phase differences effectively, improving Redmi Note 5’s autofocus speed dramatically.


The front camera of Redmi Note 5 sports a 13-megapixel sensor, complemented by an LED Selfie light. When Portrait Mode is engaged, both the front and rear cameras come with Xiaomi’s latest Beautify 4.0 mode, which has different effects enhanced by AI calculations for a natural look similar to having an expert makeup session. Even without a second sensor, the front camera achieves a great bokeh effect in Portrait Mode thanks to AI technology that helps to isolate the subject from the background.


Redmi Note 5 also uses facial recognition for unlocking the device, which is based on AI technology, enhancing the accuracy of identification for a more secure system.


China debut of Qualcomm Snapdragon 636


Redmi Note 5 uses Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 636 platform based on the 14nm manufacturing process. Its Kryo 260 architecture, 1.8GHz maximum clock speed, and the Adreno 509 GPU ensure amazing performance. Compared to Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, Snapdragon 636 has a 40 percent increase in performance — gamers can enjoy demanding 3D games on Redmi Note 5 with no worries.


Redmi Note 5 is the first device in the Redmi family to use up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM, usually only found on flagship devices. With more RAM, Redmi Note 5 can run more apps simultaneously and switch between programs even more smoothly.


Other features of Redmi Note 5 include a 5.99 inch FHD+ 18:9 full screen, large 4000mAh battery and support for fast charging. Equipped with the latest MIUI 9 operating system, Redmi Note 5 also comes with full screen display gestures so users can maximize the display area by completely hiding the navigation bar.


Redmi Note 5 comes in three versions: 3GB + 32GB, 4GB + 64GB and 6GB + 64GB, at RMB 1099, RMB 1399 and RMB 1699 respectively. It is available in four colors — Lake blue, Rose gold, Gold and Black. A simple and elegant TPU case will be included in the box with every Redmi Note 5.


Redmi Note 5 is the counterpart of Redmi Note 5 Pro, first launched in India in February. Redmi Note 5 features slight differences in specifications, and it will be available globally at a later date, with details in local markets to be announced individually.
