November 20, 2018EMI Store Blogs, SmartphonesNo Commentsadmin

After the humongous success of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Chinese smartphone giant is all set to launch its successor, the new and improved Redmi Note 6 Pro in India next week. At the time of its launch, the Redmi Note 5 Pro was a smartphone updated in every feature and has still managed to capture the attention of people. The Note 6 Pro brings some improvements to the table. Let’s have a look at Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro.


The new Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with upgrades regarding Camera, Display and an improved battery. The smartphone is Xiaomi’s first smartphone to feature a quad-camera. The dual selfie camera (20+2 MP) will be helpful in taking wide-angle selfies or artistic portraits. The primary camera remains the same as the Redmi Note 5 Pro but with improved aperture settings.


The key areas of improvements in the new Note 6 Pro are a dual front camera setup, 6.26 inches and a 19:9 display with a notch. Here’s a look at other features:
