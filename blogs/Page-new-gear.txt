Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: the looks


Like most models in the Xiaomi Redmi Note series, the two phones look very much alike.They come with large screens, thin bezels, dual vertical cameras on the back, rear fingerprint sensors and classy Mi logos at the bottom. The absence of the notch on the XIaomi Redmi Note 5 is quite refreshing — so if you are looking for that classic "nothing in the way" display experience, you won't be disappointed.






The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, on the other hand, does sport a stretchy notch — a pro for many and a con for some. Then again, the Note 6 Pro does come with 4 cameras (yep, you've read that right), so the need for extra on-screen real estate is quite understandable.



The Redmi Note 6 Pro measures 6.22 x 3.01 x 0.32 inches —which is almost identical to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 at 6.24 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches — but houses a larger 6.26 inch display. It's a very nice FHD screen with 19:9 ratio — but the one on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 does not disappoint either: 5.99-inch, 2160x1080 IPS LCD with 403 pixels per inch and 18:9 ratio.









On the color side, you get a nice selection of options on both phones. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes in classic black, bright red, trendy rose gold and light blue. The Redmi Note 5 is available in lake blue, gold and black.






Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: what's on the inside?



Most Xiaomi phones are highly praised for their value for money ratio — and both the Note 6 Pro and the Note 5 are no exceptions. Let's take a peek under the hoods.



CPU & memory


Both phones come with the same CPU model — the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 octa core clocked at 1.8GHz. As for RAM and storage, several options are available for both devices. The Redmi 6 Pro comes with either 3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage or 4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage. You can get the Note 5 with 3GB, 4GB or 6GB of RAM and either 32G or 64GB of expandable internal memory. Both phones feature Adreno 509 GPU to support your graphics and gaming.






Camera


Xiaomi Note series are well-known for their quality cameras. Take the Note 5, for instance. The phone sports a 13.0MP front camera + 12.0MP + 5.0MP dual back cameras etup, which is greatly enhanced with AI. How? Well, you get the PD dual focus that allows the phone's camera to focus quicker and better even in less than ideal light conditions. You will also be able to record smoother videos thanks to the anti-shake feature. Things get even better with selfies thanks to AI portrait mode that creates a beautiful bokeh, soft selfie giving your self-portraits a nice non-harsh light as well as Xiaomi's signature beauty mode letting you be happy with your selfies even on the worst of hair days.






The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, on the other hand, is a phone with 4 cameras. It comes with 12.0MP + 5.0MP dual rear cameras and dual front cameras as well: 2.0MP + 20.0MP. The buzzwords are all there as well and you will be able to make full use of the phone's dynamic AI-enhanced bokeh, AI portrait 2.0, AI-assisted scene recognition and more.






Other features


Battery capacity on both phones is identical - 4000mAh. Paired with the same processor, you get pretty much the same endurance for your gaming, videos, music, etc. Plus, both phones run on the MIUI 9, support 4G connectivity on two SIMs and guarantee efficient wireless connection thanks to Bluetooth 5.0.



​



Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: the verdict


Once again, we have two phones that are more similar than different. True, there are a few differences but, let's be honest, they are nothing to obsess about. You get a very decent performance on both smartphones, large displays for your media, several RAM and ROM options, good AI-enhanced cams — and more. Considering the phones' more than modest price tags, it's another touchdown for Xiaomi, on both counts. Recommending one of these devices is not just difficult — it's unnecessary, as, for the price, you will be happy with either one.
